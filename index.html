          um cells can't be destroyed, they just get recycled. The cells we're made of were once the cells of dinasaurs and before that they were the cells of a star etc. It isn't stupid, although it isn't the cells per se, but rather the molecules that make up the cells. We are all a part of everything. I think it's kind of beautiful. the very cells in our brains were once the cells of planets, it make us all related. theres actualy more cells in our brains than there are brains in our entire body
